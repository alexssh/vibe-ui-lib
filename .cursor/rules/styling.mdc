# Styling convention

- **Tailwind first**. Compose all styles with Tailwind utility classes, including states & behaviour.
- **Never** fall back to SCSS or inline styles for static design tokens.
- Define variant logic with **`cva()`** from _class‑variance‑authority_.
- Custom CSS is allowed **only** in `src/styles.css` (e.g. keyframes, CSS variables).

# Styling guideline

- Implement hover, focus, active, disabled and similar states use pseudo‑class modifiers (`hover:`, `focus-visible:`, `active:`, `disabled:`). Introduce prop‑based modifiers only for states that cannot be expressed with pseudo‑classes (e.g. selected, open), add an optional prop, and pass it to cva() as a variant.
- Default `w-full max-w-full;` override only if the design specifies fixed width.
- Text truncation `truncate` or `line-clamp‑{n}` utilities.

- **Never** add states that are not present in the design.
- **Never** add any animations unless explicitly required by design.
