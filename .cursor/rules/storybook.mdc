<storybook_convention>

Every component must be represented in Storybook. Use autodocs.

If additional usage notes are required, include a short MDX description at the top:

Expose every public prop (except `style` and `data-*`) via Storybook Controls.

For enum-like props, provide a union type and set the control to radio or select.

Organise controls alphabetically.

Supply at least one story (e.g., `Default`) or multiple ones based on variants.
