Clarity and reuse: Every component should be modular and reusable. Avoid duplication by factoring repeated UI patterns into components.

Consistency: Components must adhere to a consistent design systemâ€”color tokens, typography, spacing, and components must be unified and based on the theme (stored in `src/styles.css`).

Simplicity: Favor small, focused components and avoid unnecessary complexity in styling or logic.

Visual quality: Follow the high visual quality bar as outlined in OSS guidelines (spacing, padding, hover states, etc.)

Write code for clarity first: Prefer readable, maintainable solutions with clear names, comments where needed, and straightforward control flow. Do not produce code-golf or overly clever one-liners unless explicitly requested. Use high verbosity for writing code and code tools.
