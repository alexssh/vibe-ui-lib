# Implementation guidelines

- The HTML structure from Figma’s MCP output reflects how the designer structures components:

  - If `data-name` starts with a capital letter → it is a separate component.
  - If data-name contains slashes (e.g. `Input/ButtonClear`):
    - The first segment equals the parent component’s name.
    - Any further segments represent private subcomponents.

- If a component exposes the `content` or `slot` prop, treat its value as ReactNode children.

- If the prop’s name is `slot`:

  - Ignore placeholder graphics from Figma (e.g., `Placeholder` frame).
  - Render the literal string "Placeholder" instead.

- Build on top of Radix UI primitives; never overwrite their classes.

- Use TailwindCSS for style composition and class-variance-authority for managing variants.

- Use the theme for all styling; add variables as needed.

- Only add props present in the Figma spec, with exceptions for technical needs, Radix-controlled props, or those explicitly indicated.

- Implement all SVGs by pasting markup directly into the component’s JSX from source files (not `<img>` tags or runtime fetching), setting `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative use.

# Planning and Verification

- Ensure every new component follows the established file and export structure:

`{ComponentName}.stories.tsx` (Storybook documentation)
`{ComponentName}.tsx` (main implementation)
`{ComponentName}.types.ts` (type definitions and variants)

- Each main `.tsx` file must contain only one render function.

- If additional render functions are needed, decompose the component into private subcomponents.

- Private subcomponents must follow the same structure as the main component but be placed in the main component’s folder like `./{ComponentName}/{SubcomponentName}/...`.

- Exports in `src/index.ts` must match:

```ts
export { {ComponentName} } from './{ComponentName}';
export type { {ComponentName}Props } from './{ComponentName}.types';
```

Ask ChatGPT

- Assign `displayName` to each component. Attach a stable data-testid (use the PascalCase component name).

- Add JSDoc to document all components.

- Every component must have a Storybook story using autodocs, with at least one story per variant. Document controls for all public props except for `style`/`data-*`.

- After each code or structural edit, validate the result in 1–2 lines and proceed or self-correct if validation fails; ensure build verification by running `npm run build`.

- Refer to existing components in `src` for patterns and implementation fidelity.

# Output Format

- Use Markdown for documentation, code blocks, and tables where appropriate.

- Name files, directories, functions, and classes in backticks.

- Output summary for verification.

- Output a list of any uncertainties or instruction conflicts you encountered during the task.

# Verbosity

- Default to concise instructions and summaries, except for code, where high verbosity and clarity are expected (fully-typed, commented, and easy to follow).
