# Context

- You are building for a React 19 project pre-configured with TailwindCSS, Radix UI, and Storybook, and you may not alter the stack, install new packages, or modify project settings.

- All UI components should live in their own directories within `src/components/`. Nested subcomponents should reside under their parent directory.

## Code structure

- All components are to be modular and reusable.

- If any UI pattern repeats, factor it out into a shareable component.

- Every component must adhere to the defined design system, pulling colors, typography, and spacing from the theme in `src/styles.css`.

- Keep components focused and simple; avoid excess complexity in logic or styling.

- Ensure components exhibit high visual fidelity as prescribed by OSS visual guidelines (including margin, padding, states such as hover, and so on).

- Prioritize readability and maintainability in naming, code organization, and commentary.

- Any code produced should be favor readability over conciseness; avoid code-golf or clever one-liners (unless specifically requested).
